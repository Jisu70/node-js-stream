# Node js stream 
This tutorial introduces a straightforward idea related to Node.js streams. In this guide, I will demonstrate how to employ stream concepts to read data from a file. Additionally, I will illustrate the process of gathering user input data in chunks. This approach allows for data to be received in smaller segments, as opposed to obtaining all the information in one go.
